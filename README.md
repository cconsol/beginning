Carla is currently a PhD student at the University of Oregon in the Linguistics Department. Her main research interests are:

  - Blended learning in second language teaching
  - Emergent Technologies for language pedagogies
  - Particularly, writing/vocabulary development of Spanish learners

### Recent/ongoing projects

  - Implementation of VR and AR tools for pragmatics aquisition in the classroom
  - Spanish writing development in collaborative settings


##### I'm algo thinking about:
  - The importance of dialectal diversity in the Spanish as FL/SL classroom
  - Corpus linguistics applications for more effective teaching in the classroom 
  - Research that is readily available and accessible for language teachers around the world
